# WebLN
WebLN is a game that consists of showing some inventions, the selected invention is the oldest, that invention is the one to start with and you have to find the most modern invention that follows it in the list. And so on. If you guess correctly you get a point, if you fail a point is subtracted.
Once you find all the arrows, an animation will be shown placing the inventions in place and you automatically move to the next level, which is the same but with more inventions and so on.
The three players with the highest score will get a prize in satoshis.
In order for players to have access to the game they must fill out a form and pay the fee (in satoshis) corresponding to the registration. This is done with the LNBits Pay Links extension.
Cosas por hacer:
    1. Que funcione correctamente lo de los pagos
    2. Que sea responsive
    3. Colocar los archivos donde corresponda bien ordenados y no el caos que hay ahora, aunque yo entiendo mi caos jajaja
    4. Odiar github eternamente
